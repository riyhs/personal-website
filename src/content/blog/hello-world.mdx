There is something incredibly satisfying about the phrase "Hello World." It represents the beginning of a journey, the moment where logic meets creativity.

For me, coding has always been about more than just syntax or algorithms, it's about the agency to build things that didn't exist before. Whether I'm debugging a complex system, competing in algorithmic contests, or mentoring others, I'm driven by the potential of technology to solve real problems. This space will serve as a log of that journey, a place to document what I learn, what I build, and how I grow as an engineer. The future is bright, and I'm excited to write the code that shapes it.
